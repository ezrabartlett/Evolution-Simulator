# Evolution-Simulator
Curiosity project. The goal will be to generate complex behavior and patterns by defining a few very simple rules.

I'm pushing some messy files from my personal computer as part of my initiative to organize my projects.

If you want to run this project, you need to have pip and python 3. 
  
  Clone the repository, then run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
  
  In the root directory, run "python EvolutionSimMain.py"
